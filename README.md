CRIME RATE ANALYSIS WITH MACHINE LEARNING

This project focuses on analyzing crime rates using machine learning techniques implemented in Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, data visualization, and comparison of various machine learning algorithms for crime rate prediction.

OVERVIEW

Understanding crime rates and their predictors is crucial for law enforcement agencies and policymakers. This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze crime data and predict crime rates in different regions. By leveraging Python's machine learning libraries, we preprocess the data, visualize it to gain insights, and compare the performance of different algorithms for crime rate prediction.

FEATURES

•	Data Preprocessing: The raw crime data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for analysis.
•	Data Visualization: Various data visualization techniques are employed to explore the relationships between different variables and gain insights into the factors influencing crime rates.
•	Algorithm Comparison: Several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression Model, KNN Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Lasso Model, and Naive Bayes, are used to predict crime rates. The performance of these algorithms is compared to identify the most suitable model for crime rate prediction.

USAGE

•	Data Preprocessing: Use the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to preprocess the crime data.
•	Data Visualization: Explore and visualize the crime data using the data_visualization.ipynb notebook.
•	Algorithm Comparison: Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms for crime rate prediction using the algorithm_comparison.ipynb notebook.

REQUIREMENTS

•	Python 3.x
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	scikit-learn
•	Other necessary libraries for data preprocessing and visualization (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
